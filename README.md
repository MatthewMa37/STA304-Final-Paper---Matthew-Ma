# STA304-Final Paper - Matthew Ma


In this package, include a RMD file about my work, the zip version of the CSV file (the original csv file is greater than 25mb, therefore cannot be uploaded) that I used for the final paper, and the pdf of the final paper, the bibliograhy text, and the project.Rproj. 

In this paper, I used the data provided by open-data-Toronto investigated how did Covid-19 influence Toronto in the very beginning stage, the stage after the vaccine is popularized, and the stage of Omicron(Now). I also made a model to predict the trend of infection in the future 30 days.


Since I the CSV file that I used is greater than 25MB, which cannot be uploaded to GitHub directly, I compressed it into a zip file called “Data-Final Paper.zip”

If you still cannot download the zip or you cannot open it, This is the URL of the the csv file:
